# Safarizone
## Description
This is a little endless-runner game in the style of the chrome "dino game".
It is written in Java and is supposed to run in the default windows command prompt.

Requires the JNativeHook library (https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook).

## 1. Sprint Deadline: 01.01.22 

### Retro
Because of the holidays there were only a few Dailys so the Devs couldn't keep in touch with each other, Altough increments were created, the lack of communication caused that pushing the programm to github didn't work so the goal of the 1. Sprint couldn't be accomplished. We decided to include the goal of the 1. Sprint into the 2. Sprint and improve the current game version. We also agreed that the Devs stay in contact with each other to decide who pushes what and to be up-to-date about the others' parts of the programm at least once a week


## 2. Sprint Deadline: 20.01.22

### Retro
The Dailys improved the efficiency in our team a lot and we successfully pushed our first game version. Updating works way better now thanks to frequent communication. Our Devs work as a well-trained team and we have a very friendly atmosphere in our group. Sadly our PO left us so besides being Scrum Master I suggested to take the duties of the PO as well. The game is almost complete so for the 3. Sprint we decided to add the easter-egg request and make overall improvements  

## 3. Sprint Deadline: 27.01.22

### Retro
The project was successfully finished and we're excited to present our game.
